# Description

I like flags, so I wanted to make a flag trivia game!

# Next Steps

Right now, there are three hardcoded questions with hardcoded options and answers. To extend on this, you should 
instead make a list of flag images and options, and then designate the correct answers (e.g. one option is to store
each image in a dictionary where the key is the image and the value is the country's name). 

Instead of using three different screens, you could also simply replace the items on the screen after returning from
the correct/wrong answer screen. This would reduce the number of screens significantly and allow the quiz to be much
longer.
